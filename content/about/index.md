I'm a mechanical engineer and computer scientist by training, and have been fortunate to experience a diverse range of work. Some things I've been a part of include:

- [WearHawk](http://wearhawk.com), a startup developing innovative conveyor monitoring technologies
- an augmented reality app for mine planning
- [autonomous haul trucks](https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/nobody-at-the-wheel-at-bhps-jimblebar-iron-ore-mine-site-ng-b88529442z) in mining
- early development of a mountain bike [suspension tuning system](https://www.quarq.com/)
- [hipflask](http://hello.hipflaskapp.com/), a socially networked gig guide
- maintenance of heavy haul railways
- pilot program and first two years of [CoderDojo WA](http://coderdojowa.org.au/)

I'm keenly interested in data science, statistics, and machine learning. 
Outside of work I enjoy photography, working out, and relaxing with music and a tasty beverage.

### Education

I completed a double degree in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Western Australia in 2013, majoring in computation and graduating with first class honours.


### This site

This site was put together as a portfolio and an opportunity to learn more about topics I find interesting, publishing content from R, using D3, and automated build processes. Hopefully you find it interesting and useful too!

Some tools used include [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) for R, with a slightly modified theme from [Bootstrapious](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-creative-portfolio-theme).
It's built using a [wercker bucket](https://app.wercker.com/cwebby/cwebby/runs) tied to my [Github](https://github.com/callumwebb/cwebby) repository.
