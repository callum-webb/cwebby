I'm a mechanical engineer and computer scientist by training, and have been fortunate to experience a range of work in both areas as well as their intersection. Some things I've been a part of include:

- an augmented reality app for mine planning
- predictive models for conveyor belt wear rate
- a mountain bike [suspension tuning system](https://www.quarq.com/) 
- [hipflask](http://hello.hipflaskapp.com/), a socially networked gig guide
- maintenance of heavy haul railways
- autonomous haul trucks in mining
- pilot program and first two years of [CoderDojo WA](http://coderdojowa.org.au/)

More recently I've developed a keen interest for data science and statistics. Outside of work I enjoy photography, working out, and occassionally playing trombone.

#### Education

Growing up, I loved to tinker with computers, electronics, and mechanical systems. I couldn't decide which was most fun, so I settled on doing a double degree in Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering. 

I completed my studies at the University of Western Australia in 2013, majoring in computation and graduating with first class honours.

I'm happy to report that my appreciation of Lego is still as strong as ever!

This site was built using [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) for R, and a slightly modified theme from xx. 
It's built using a [wercker bucket](https://app.wercker.com/cwebby/cwebby/runs) tied to my [github](https://github.com/callumwebb/cwebby) repository.
